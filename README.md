# Kahoot Java Client
This repository is a function Java HTTP client for the online game [Kahoot!](https://kahoot.com) It acts as a browser in order to validate itself and enter a game. All the code has been reverse engineered from the official Kahoot JavaScript web app-- it is all undocumented (and their code is obfuscated heavily). As such, it is vulnerable to stop working very suddenly.

# Disclaimer
I have no affiliation with Kahoot it any way. I do not work for Kahoot, I do not know anyone who works for Kahoot, and this repository is not an official Kahoot client.
